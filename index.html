                <p>My name is Adrian Andrews, I have recently started my journey to becoming a successful web developer.
                    I am currently a Temple University undergrad student, I was supposed to be starting my junior year,
                    but I decided to defer for the year. This allowed me some time to self-reflect on what I really
                    wanted to do with my life. Previously I was studying kinesiology but I came to the realization that
                    that wasn't something that I genuninely wanted to do with my life.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>During my first year off from school I used that time as an opportunity to try and find my niche.
                    This pretty much consisted of me working various jobs to see where I felt most comfortable in.
                    Although all of these jobs have undeniably progressed me down the truly never ending path towards my
                    self-actualization, I felt no genuine passion for any of them. They all felt temporary and
                    completely dull. This brings me to how I got into coding. Through a somewhat close friend I was able
                    to come across a web development program being hosted by <a
                        href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/lps/welcome">University of Pennsylvania</a>.
                </p>
                <br>
                <P>Coding to me at that point was something that although admititngly I had little to no experience in,
                    the experience I did have in it brought me more joy in doing it than anything else I ever attempted.
                    It always felt like art to me, to the untrained eye it may seem unnecessarily convoluted and
                    pragmatic when in reality its a multi-dimensional world contantly metamorphosing itself. I hope by
                    the end of the programs I have enough knowledge to properly navigate through such a dynamically rich
                    field.</P>
