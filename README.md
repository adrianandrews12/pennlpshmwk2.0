# pennlpshmwk2.0

This is my demo portfolio page that I will be updating all of my future work on to, to not only more accessible to employers but to also be more marektable. It consists of an about page that gives a general overview of who I am, a portfolio page that links to my github repositories, and a contact page.

This was made by using html/css/bootstrap/googlefonts
